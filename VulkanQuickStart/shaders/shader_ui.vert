	no specific demands in this regard. Compensation of roughly 1% of net or $5 per user license seems appropriate, but is not legally binding.

	In lay terms, if you make a profit by using the VulkanQuickStart Project (violating the spirit of Open Source Software), I expect a reasonable share for my efforts.
