	The author's interpretation of GPL 3 is that if you receive money for the use or distribution of the TriMesh Library or a derivative product, GPL 3 no longer applies.

	Under those circumstances, the author expects and may legally pursue a reasoble share of the income. To avoid the complexity of agreements and negotiation, the author makes
	no specific demands in this regard. Compensation of roughly 1% of net or $5 per user license seems appropriate, but is not legally binding.

	In lay terms, if you make a profit by using the VulkanQuickStart Project (violating the spirit of Open Source Software), I expect a reasonable share for my efforts.
